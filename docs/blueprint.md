# **App Name**: TRT Haber Redesign

## Core Features:

- Header Clone: Faithfully replicate the header design, including the logo, navigation menu, search bar, and live TV section as present on trthaber.com.
- Main Content Replication: Mimic the main content area, including featured news sections, category listings, and the overall grid layout for articles. Make it responsive across devices.
- Footer Replication: Reproduce the footer section with its various links, copyright information, and any other widgets or elements present.
- Interactive Elements Cloning: Match the hover effects, transitions, and interactive elements found throughout the trthaber.com website.
- AI News Summarizer: Implement an AI-powered news summary tool, that provides a concise summary of each news article (using a large language model as a summarization tool) that users can toggle. Show the original source article as default, and the LLM-created summary upon user request. The tool helps users grasp the content quickly.

## Style Guidelines:

- Use the primary blue color (#003DA5) prominently for headers, accents, and interactive elements.
- Incorporate a secondary light grey color (#F2F2F2) for background elements and article containers.
- Accent color: Use a bright red (#E50000) for highlights, urgent news indicators, and certain button states to draw attention.
- Maintain consistent typography throughout, mirroring the font styles, sizes, and weights used on trthaber.com for headers, body text, and captions.
- Recreate the grid-based layout precisely to ensure content is well-organized and easy to navigate, matching the original site's structure.
- Implement icons that reflect the style of those found on trthaber.com, ensuring visual consistency in navigation and interactive elements.
